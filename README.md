Network and services for basic functionality

Note that many other stacks use the VPC, which may lead to many invisible dependencies.

QSMR-services in odin-l2-lambda (despite the name) runs in the Odin-API cluster, which also is a hidden dependency.

Network interfaces might be laying around in the VPC.
